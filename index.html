  <h1>Let's Play Connect 4!</h1>

  <p>Each player chooses a colour and presses the Add button. Start the game.
    Game starts with Player 1's turn. Players alternate turns. On each turn, 
    a player click the top row to drop a piece into that column until a 
    player gets four-in-a-row (horiz, vert, or diag) or until the board 
    fills.  Can start new game with existing players or refresh the game 
    to make a new list of players.</p>
